<h1>Hello!! My name is Paulina Ai </h1>
<p></p>
<h3>About me: </h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial">I'm currently a rising senior in highschool.
I believe that encouraging women in STEM begins with early support in elementary 
through highschool.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">Resources and role models are everything!</p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-family: Arial">In addition to loving STEM, I am an avid game-watcher (definition: someone who likes
watching games being played rather than playing them),</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial"> an indie-head (definition: rock on!), and the #1 supporter of my dog, Pecan.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Education: </h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial"> My academic interests include CS + Engineering. I am well 
versed in Python, Java, and HTML (2 truths and a lie)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope you have a nice day!</p>
